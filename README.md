# Future
Hello,
As I'm sure you have heard, Discord is changing the requirements for bots on the platform. The way the bot currently works, using messages with the d! prefix, will not be supported in a few months.
As the author of several bots, including DebateBot, and a busy college student, I need to figure out the best way to divide up my time. I need to know if the community, you all, think this bot project should continue, or if it should fade quietly into the night, one of many bots Discord's changes have killed. Please voice your opinions here: https://forms.gle/VQhtCBkVfwxGZDPK7
My former library of choice, discord.py, was deprecated due to the changes Discord is forcing upon developers. Updating DebateBot will require large overhauls to bring the code to a new library. I'm happy to do so--but only if this work will actually be used by the community.
If this is the end of the road for DebateBot, then so be it. This project has grown larger than I ever thought it would have, and I'm grateful for every user I've helped. Thank you all.
Sincerely,
Travis Weir
Developer of DebateBot

When you run d!create (name) (side1) (side2), lots of things happen. First, a category channel is created. Next, channels for discussion and each side are created. Finally, roles are created, and the debate begins. Participants join sides and the facilitator gives each side the "floor" in the main channel at a time.
